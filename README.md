# Enthuse

This project uses the following technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org) and [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) for frontend
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) for the backend
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for the database
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/basics/usagewithreact) for state management between React components


## Configuration

Make sure to add your own `MONGOURI` from your [mLab](http://mlab.com) database in `config/keys.js`.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  mongoURI: "YOUR_MONGO_URI_HERE",
  secretOrKey: "secret"
};
```

##  Starting the Application

### Run the below first
```javascript
// Install dependencies for server & client
npm install && npm run client-install

// Run client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

// Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
```
### Unfortunately, there is more. 

There is currently a bug where installing will install duplicate dependencies the in client and server, causing Enthuse to fail start up. This is the first ticket when development on the project resumes, but for now you must manually delete the packages from the server.

All folders in /node_modules starting with the following must be deleted:
* babel-eslint
* babel-loader
* babel-jest
* jest
* webpack
* webpack-dev-server
* eslint
